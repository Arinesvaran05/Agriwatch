# Admin Profile Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Email Verification Status Not Displaying Correctly

**Problem**: The admin profile page was showing "Not Verified" even when the email was verified.

**Root Cause**: Field name mismatch between backend and frontend:
- Backend was returning `isEmailVerified` 
- Frontend was expecting `is_email_verified`

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated all login APIs (`admin-login.php`, `user-login.php`, `login.php`) to return `is_email_verified` instead of `isEmailVerified`
- Ensured consistent field naming across all authentication endpoints

### 2. Account Creation Date Not Displaying

**Problem**: The account creation date was not showing on the admin profile page.

**Root Cause**: Field name mismatch and missing data:
- Backend was returning `created_at` 
- Frontend was looking for `createdAt`
- Some APIs were not returning the `created_at` field at all

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated all login APIs to include `created_at` field in the SELECT queries
- Fixed frontend template to use `created_at` instead of `createdAt`
- Updated profile update API to return complete user data including `created_at`

### 3. Data Inconsistency After Profile Updates

**Problem**: After updating profile information, the displayed data might not reflect the latest changes.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `refreshUserData()` method to fetch fresh user data from the server
- Enhanced profile update response to include complete user data
- Added automatic data refresh after successful profile updates

## Files Modified

### Backend APIs
1. **`api/auth/admin-login.php`**
   - Added `created_at` to SELECT query
   - Changed `isEmailVerified` to `is_email_verified`

2. **`api/auth/user-login.php`**
   - Added `created_at` to SELECT query
   - Changed `isEmailVerified` to `is_email_verified`

3. **`api/auth/login.php`**
   - Added `created_at` to SELECT query
   - Changed `isEmailVerified` to `is_email_verified`

4. **`api/profile/update.php`**
   - Enhanced to return complete user data including `created_at`
   - Added `role` and `is_email_verified` to response

### Frontend Components
1. **`src/app/components/admin/profile/admin-profile.component.ts`**
   - Fixed field reference from `createdAt` to `created_at`
   - Added `refreshUserData()` method
   - Enhanced profile update handling
   - Added debugging console logs

2. **`src/app/components/user/profile/profile.component.ts`**
   - Fixed field reference from `createdAt` to `created_at`

## Testing

To verify the fixes are working:

1. **Run the test file**: `test-admin-profile-fix.php` to check database structure and data
2. **Check browser console**: Look for the debug logs showing user data
3. **Verify display**: 
   - Email verification status should show correctly
   - Account creation date should be visible
   - Data should update properly after profile changes

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Email Verification Status**: Should correctly display "✓ Verified" or "✗ Not Verified" based on actual database value
2. **Account Creation Date**: Should display the actual date when the account was created
3. **Data Consistency**: Profile information should remain consistent between page loads and updates
4. **Real-time Updates**: Changes should be reflected immediately after successful profile updates

## Database Requirements

Ensure the `users` table has these fields:
- `id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
- `name` (VARCHAR)
- `email` (VARCHAR, UNIQUE)
- `role` (ENUM: 'user', 'admin')
- `is_email_verified` (BOOLEAN)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

## Notes

- The fixes maintain backward compatibility
- All authentication endpoints now return consistent data structure
- Frontend components have been updated to handle the correct field names
- Added debugging to help troubleshoot any future issues
