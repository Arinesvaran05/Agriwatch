2. **SMTP Settings**: You may need to configure SMTP in XAMPP's php.ini
3. **Alternative**: For production, consider using services like:
   - SendGrid
   - Mailgun
   - PHPMailer with SMTP

### **Testing Email Sending**
- Check your email inbox after signup/forgot password
- Check the email log at `http://localhost/agriwatch/view_emails.php`
- If emails don't arrive, check XAMPP's mail configuration
